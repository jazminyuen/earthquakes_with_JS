# Earthquakes
## Project Overview

Using JavaScript's Leaflet library and Mapbox API, I have created visualizations of earthquake data from the past seven days. The data is in GeoJSON format from the U.S. Geological Survey.

## The Visualization

The user has the option of three different base layers and three overlays that display:
1. All earthquakes
2. Tectonic plates
3. Major earthquakes with a magnitude of 4.5 or greater

The locations of each earthquake are marked with a circle with a radius scaled to the their magnitude. A legend is provided to as these earthquakes are color-coded by magnitude as well. 

In addition, the user can click on each point to display the exact magnitude and location of the earthquake.
